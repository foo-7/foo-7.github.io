                <h2><strong>Subjects of study</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility -- as long as the subjects<br/>
                    somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicayed researcher, and just<br/>
                    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued<br/>
                    by are as follows, in order of priority:<br/>
                <ol>
                    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
                    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br/>
                        audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
                    <li><u>HTML</u> and <u>CSS</u> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the<br/>
                    research to take, required staff and other resourcea, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.

                <h2><strong>Exotic dance moves</strong></h2>
                <p>
                    Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <i>did</i> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br/>
                    my favorite dances are as follows, with definitions:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance aorund<br/>
                        in a circle, to encourage their livestock to be 'fruitful'.<br/>
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br/>
                        involved buddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly<br/>
                        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired<br/>
                        modern styles such as Twerking.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Arctic robot dance</dt>
                    <dd>
                        An interesting example of historic misinformation, ENglish exploeres in the 1960s believed to have<br/>
                        discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants<br/>
                        of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this<br/>
                        because they were really cold.
                    </dd>
